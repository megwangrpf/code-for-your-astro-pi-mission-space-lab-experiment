## Running your experiment for 3 hours

Your experiment will be allocated 180 minutes of runtime on the ISS. Therefore, your code should run for no more than this three-hour period and should gracefully shut down any activity (e.g. close the camera, close any open files, clear the LED matrix). After three hours, your code will be terminated automatically by the Astro Pi, but this may cause data to be lost or recorded incorrectly, so you should not rely on this to stop your program.

One way to stop your program after a specific length of time is using the `datetime` Python library. This library makes it easy to work with times and compare them. Doing so without the library is not always straightforward: it's easy to get it wrong using normal mathematics. For example, it's simple to work out the difference in time between 10:30 and 10:50 (subtract 30 from 50), but slightly more complicated when you have 10:44 and 11:17 (add (60 - 44) to 17). Things become even trickier if the two times are split across two days (for example, the difference in minutes between 23:07 on Monday 30 May and 11:43 on Tuesday 1 June). The `datetime` library makes this type of operation much simpler by allowing you to create `datetime` objects that you can simply add to or subtract from each other.  

By recording and storing the time at the start of your experiment, you can then repeatedly check to see if the current time is greater than that start time plus a certain number of minutes, seconds, or hours. This difference is known as a `timedelta`.  

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from time import sleep

# create a `datetime` variable to store the start time
start_time = datetime.now()
# create a `datetime` variable to store the current time
# (these will be almost the same at the start)
now_time = datetime.now()
# run a loop for 2 minutes
while (now_time < start_time + timedelta(minutes=2)):
    print("Doing stuff")
    sleep(1)
    # update the current time
    now_time = datetime.now()
```

**Note:** When deciding on the runtime for your code, make sure you take into account how long it takes for your loop to complete a cycle. So if you want to make use of the full three-hour (180-minute) experiment slot available, but each loop through your code takes 6 minutes to complete, then your `timedelta` should be `180-6 = 174` minutes, to ensure that your code finishes __before__ the three hours have elapsed.
