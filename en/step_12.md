## Resources

There are a wealth of resources available to help you succeed! 

Here are a few resources to wet your appetite:

- For a Life In Space experiment a great resource is the [Life In Space pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/life-in-space). This includes projects to help you [get started with the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/3) and [collecting data](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/sense-hat-data-logger/4), and [designing your experiment](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/experiment-design/3).
- For a Life On Earth experiment there is a [separate pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/life-on-earth) that includes projects to help you [use the camera](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera/6) and even [calculate the speed of the ISS using computer vision](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-iss-speed/5).
- NDVI experiments will find the [NDVI project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/astropi-ndvi) very helpful
- Machine learning experiments will find the [image classification project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/image-id-coral) an excellent guide to get rolling.
