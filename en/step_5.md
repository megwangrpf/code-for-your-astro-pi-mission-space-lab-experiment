## Finding the location of the ISS

Using the Python `ephem` library, you can calculate the positions of space objects within out solar system. This includes the Sun, the Moon, the planets, and many Earth satellites such as the ISS. So you can work out the ISS’s current location above the Earth, which you can use to identify whether the ISS is flying over land or sea, or which country it is flying over.

For accurate calculations, you need to provide `ephem` with the most recent two-line element (TLE) set for the ISS. TLE is a data format used to convey sets of orbital elements that describe the orbits of Earth satellites. You can get the latest ISS TLE data (along with the same information in other formats) [here](http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/stations.txt){:target="_blank"}. These three lines should then be pasted into your code and passed in as arguments when you create an `iss` object in your program.

```python
import ephem

name = "ISS (ZARYA)"        	 
line1 = "1 25544U 98067A   18032.92935684  .00002966  00000-0  52197-4 0  99911 25544U 98067A   18032.92935684  .00002966  00000-0  52197-4 0  9991"
line2 = "2 25544  51.6438 332.9972 0003094  62.2964  46.0975 15.54039537 97480"

iss = ephem.readtle(name, line1, line2)

iss.compute()

print(iss.sublat, iss.sublong)
```

If you wanted your experiment to run when the ISS is above a particular location on Earth, you could use the values of latitude and longitude to trigger some other action. Remember that the ISS' orbit does not pass over everywhere on Earth, and that more of our planet's surface is water than land. So in your three-hour experimental window, the chances of passing over a very specific city or location will be low.

To try out how this could be useful in your program, modify the code above so that it will print a message when ISS is above the southern hemisphere.

---hint---
If a location is in the southern hemisphere, it has a negative latitude because it is "below" the equator.

You can test whether a number is negative by checking if it is larger than 0.

Your file should look like this:
```python
import ephem

name = "ISS (ZARYA)"        	 
line1 = "1 25544U 98067A   18032.92935684  .00002966  00000-0  52197-4 0  99911 25544U 98067A   18032.92935684  .00002966  00000-0  52197-4 0  9991"
line2 = "2 25544  51.6438 332.9972 0003094  62.2964  46.0975 15.54039537 97480"
iss = ephem.readtle(name, line1, line2)

iss.compute()

if iss.sublat < 0:
  print("In Southern hemisphere")
```

Note that when your code runs on the Space Station, the most accurate and up-to-date telemetry data will be used automatically, so you don’t need to write any routines to update this data as part of your program. Just include the most recent TLE lines when you submit your code.
